      "This function `calcColor` calculates the color of a pixel in a raytraced image. Let's break down the steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Step 1: Intersection Calculation:** Iterates through a linked list of shapes (`ShapeNode`) and calculates the intersection time of the ray with each shape. The results (time and shape) are stored in a `std::vector` called `times`.\n",
      "- **Step 2: Sorting Intersections:** Sorts the `times` vector based on the intersection times using `insertionSort`.\n",
      "- **Step 3: Skybox Handling:** If no intersections are found (or the closest intersection is at infinity), the color is determined by the skybox. The skybox color is retrieved based on the ray direction.\n",
      "- **Step 4: Closest Intersection:** If intersections exist, the closest intersection is used. The intersection point is calculated.\n",
      "- **Step 5: Material Color:** The color of the intersected object is retrieved using `getColor`. This function likely considers material properties.\n",
      "- **Step 6: Lighting:** The lighting at the intersection point is calculated using `getLight`. This likely involves calculating diffuse and specular lighting components. The calculated light is combined with the material color and ambient light.\n",
      "- **Step 7: Recursion (Opacity and Reflection):** If the material is transparent (opacity < 1) or reflective (reflection > 0), the function recursively calls itself to calculate the color contribution from the refracted and/or reflected rays.  A small offset is added to the ray origin to avoid self-intersection.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Are all operations strictly necessary?**\n",
      "\n",
      "`insertionSort` is likely inefficient for large numbers of shapes. A faster sorting algorithm would be beneficial.  The use of `std::vector` might involve unnecessary memory allocations and deallocations during the loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Optimization Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Replace `insertionSort` with a more efficient sorting algorithm like `std::sort`.** This will improve performance significantly for larger scenes.\n",
      "2. **Pre-allocate the `times` vector.** This will prevent repeated allocations during the loop.\n",
      "3. **Use a small epsilon value for comparisons with floating-point numbers.** This will help to avoid issues with floating-point inaccuracies.\n",
